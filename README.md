# Turn.js Storybook

A simple HTML-based storybook with a realistic page-flipping effect powered by [Turn.js](http://www.turnjs.com/). This project includes four sample pages with placeholder images and text.

## How to Edit Title and Author

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Look for the `<header>` section near the top:
   ```html
   <header>
     <h1>My Awesome Book</h1>
     <p>By Me</p>
   </header>
